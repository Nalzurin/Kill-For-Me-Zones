Adds a new zone that allows the player to automatically designate pawns that enter it to be killed.

Has options for humanlikes, animals, mechanoids, entities, hostile and neutral pawns, as well as the ability to unmark the pawn if it leaves the zone.

Can change the interval between zone checks in the mod settings.
